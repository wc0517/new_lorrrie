      <description>Dear Lorrie,
&amp;quot;Just another boring night, nothing special will happen.&amp;quot; I said to myself. I looked up at the sky, couldnâ€™t see any stars. I clicked the confirm button and sent my request to you. Then everything started to change.
As the wind blew, I saw something bright was hidden behind the clouds. It shines a shaft of light on me. I was there, standing still, staring at it. People nearby walked in and walked out, no one noticed it.</description>
